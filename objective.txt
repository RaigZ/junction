A currently working in developement environment for me to understand Lua, also to 
establish this new gamemode in Garry's Mod. I am not quite sure what this gamemode 
will be about, but it seems that I am getting the basic understanding into how to 
implement objects and tables in Lua.

How to play:

The player is chosen one of the four factions.
Depending on the faction, points will progress
as the player frags other PLAYERS. While in the
process of fragging other players, there is the
obstacle of NPCs trying to attack you which do
NOT progress points. If the points meet the
threshold, shall the game end.

Special Units:

Special units are those who are special to the 
faction. 

For example, Gordon Freeman is a special
unit to the Resistance faction. 

Breen is special to the Combine faction. 

Xen has the GMan who is OP for unexplainable reasons, 
but the GMan must attend other matters of searching for 
more employers once the timer of his mayhem ends. 

Zombies harbor multiple units of their own...
